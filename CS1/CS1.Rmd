     xlab="GDP [M$]",
     ylab="Total energy consumption [GWh]")
```

```{r}
plot(log10(data$GDP), log10(data$TOTALCONS),
     main="loglog plot of Total energy consumption over GDP for multiple countries in the year 2000",
     xlab="GDP [log10(M$)]",
     ylab="Total energy consumption [log10(GWh)]")

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
